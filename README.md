# Gatekeeper Policy Manager (GPM)

[![Build Status](https://ci.sighup.io/api/badges/sighupio/gatekeeper-policy-manager/status.svg)](https://ci.sighup.io/sighupio/gatekeeper-policy-manager)

Gatekeeper Policy Manager is a simple **read-only** web UI for viewing OPA Gatekeeper policies' status in a Kubernetes Cluster.

It can display all the defined **Constraint Templates** with their rego code, and all the **Contraints** with its current status, violations, enforcement action, matches definitions, etc.

## Requirements

You'll need OPA Gatekeeper running in your cluster and at least some constraint templates and constraints defined to take advantage of this tool.

ℹ You can easily deploy Gatekeeper to your cluster using the (also open source) [Fury Kubernetes OPA](https://github.com/sighupio/fury-kubernetes-opa) module.

## Deploying GPM

To deploy Gatekeeper Policy Manager to your cluster, apply the provided `kustomization` file running the following command:

```shell
kubectl apply -k .
```

By default, this will create a deployment and a service both with the name `gatekeper-policy-manager` in the `gatekeeper-system` namespace. We invite you to take a look into the `kustomization.yaml` file to do further configuration.

> The app can be run as a POD in a Kubernetes cluster or locally with a `kubeconfig` file. It will try its best to autodetect the correct configuration.

Once you've deployed the application, if you haven't set up an ingress, you can access the web-UI using port-forward:

```bash
kubectl -n gatekeeper-system port-forward  svc/gatekeeper-policy-manager 8080:80
````

Then access it with your browser on: [http://127.0.0.1:8080](http://127.0.0.1:8080)

## Running locally

GPM can also be run locally using docker and a `kubeconfig`, assuming that the `kubeconfig` file you want to use is located at `~/.kube/config` the command to run GPM locally would be:

```bash
docker run -v ~/.kube/config:/root/.kube/config -p 8080:8080 quay.io/sighup/gatekeeper-policy-manager:v0.3.0
```

Then access it with your browser on: [http://127.0.0.1:8080](http://127.0.0.1:8080)

> You can also run the flask app directly, see the development section for further information.

## Configuration

GPM is a stateless application, but it can be configured using environment variables. The possible configurations are:

| Env Var Name                      | Description                                                                                                       | Default                |

## Development

GPM is written in Python using the Flask framework for the backend and Fromantic-UI for the frontend. To develop GPM, you'll need to create a Python 3 virtual environment, install all the dependencies specified in the provided `requirements.txt` and you are good to start hacking.

The following commands should get you up and running:

```bash
# Create a virtualenv
$ python3 -m venv env
# Activate it
$ source ./env/bin/activate
# Install all the dependencies
$ pip install -r app/requirements.txt
# Run the development server
$ FLASK_APP=app/app.py flask run
```

> Access to a Kubernetes cluster with Gatekeeper deployed is recommended to debug the application.
>
> You'll need an OIDC provider to test the OIDC authentication. You can use our [fury-kubernetes-keycloak](https://github.com/sighupio/fury-kubernetes-keycloak) module.

## Roadmap

The following is a wishlist of features that we would like to add to GPM (in no particular order):

- List the constraints that are currently using a `ConstraintTemplate`
- Polished OIDC authentication
- LDAP authentication
- Better syntax highlighting for the rego code snippets
- Root-less docker image
- Multi-cluster view
- Minimal write capabilities?
- Re-write app in Golang?

Please, let us know if you are using GPM and what features would you like to have by creating an issue here in GitHub
